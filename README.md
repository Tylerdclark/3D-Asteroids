# 3D-Asteroids

Simple 3D unity game I made for a class. You are a ship in space and are shooting/avoiding asteroids. One hit and you're a goner!

## Instuctions

* Point the mouse to aim (the ship will fire for you)
* ASDW or arrow keys to move
* ESC to pause (will also exit fullscreen mode, oops)
